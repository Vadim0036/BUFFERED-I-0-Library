This project involves the development of a custom input/output library that mimics the functionality of the standard C library stdio.h. The primary objective is to provide buffered input and output functions, enhancing performance by reducing the number of direct read and write operations to the system.

Key features of the library include:

    Buffered Input and Output: Implement functions that temporarily store data in memory (buffer) before performing read and write operations, leading to improved efficiency, especially in scenarios involving frequent I/O operations.

    Compatibility with Standard Functions: Emulate the interface of stdio.h to allow users to easily integrate this library into existing C projects without extensive code changes.

    Customizable Buffer Size: Offer options for users to define the buffer size according to their specific application needs, allowing for greater flexibility and performance optimization.

    Error Handling: Incorporate robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that users are informed of any issues during I/O operations, enhancing the reliability of the library.

    Memory Management: Implement careful memory management practices to minimize leaks and ensure the efficient allocation and deallocation of buffers.

This library serves as a practical exercise in system programming and memory management in C, providing users with a foundational understanding of how buffered I/O works at a low level. It aims to contribute to the open-source community by offering a reliable, efficient, and educational tool for developers.
